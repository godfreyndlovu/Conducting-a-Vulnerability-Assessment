# Vulnerability Assessment Report

**Date:** 10 January 2024

---

## System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of the Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## Scope

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

## Purpose

The purpose of this vulnerability assessment is to identify and evaluate potential risks associated with the publicly accessible database server. This server is critical as it stores valuable customer and marketing data, which is essential for tracking performance and personalizing marketing efforts. Securing this server is imperative to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches that could disrupt business operations and damage the company's reputation.

## Risk Assessment

| Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------- | ---- |
| Hacker        | Exfiltrate sensitive information | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| Employee      | Disrupt mission-critical operations | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| Customer      | Alter/Delete critical information | 1 | 3 | 3 |

## Approach

In this qualitative vulnerability assessment, we evaluated the risk based on subjective judgment and expert knowledge. The selection of threat sources and events was driven by the open access nature of the server and its critical role in business operations. We focused on high-level risks that could significantly impact the organization, ensuring that our findings align with the company's strategic goals and operational requirements.

## Remediation Strategy

To mitigate the identified risks, we recommend implementing robust authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms. This includes enforcing strong password policies, utilizing role-based access controls, and deploying multi-factor authentication. Additionally, encrypting data in transit using TLS and restricting IP access to trusted corporate offices will enhance the security posture of the database server.

# Detailed Rephrased Sections

## Purpose

The aim of this assessment is to thoroughly analyze the security vulnerabilities of the company's publicly accessible database server. This server is pivotal in storing and managing critical marketing and customer data, which is utilized to enhance and personalize marketing campaigns. Ensuring the security of this server is crucial to safeguard sensitive information, maintain business continuity, and uphold the company's reputation against potential data breaches or unauthorized access.

## Approach

This assessment utilizes a qualitative approach to evaluate the potential risks. By relying on expert judgment and an understanding of the system's vulnerabilities, we identified significant threat sources and events that could impact the business. The open access nature of the server increases the risk, necessitating a thorough assessment of possible security incidents. The evaluation of threats considered their likelihood and potential impact on the company's operations and data integrity.

## Remediation Strategy

To address the identified vulnerabilities, the following security measures should be implemented:

1. **Enforce strong authentication mechanisms:** Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the server.
2. **Implement role-based access controls:** Limit user privileges based on their role within the organization to reduce the risk of internal threats.
3. **Encrypt data in transit:** Upgrade to TLS encryption to secure data being transmitted between the server and clients.
4. **Restrict access:** Utilize IP whitelisting to allow only known and trusted IP addresses to connect to the server, thereby reducing exposure to external threats.

## Risk Assessment (Extended)

| Threat Source       | Threat Event                                       | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---- |
| Hacker              | Exfiltrate sensitive information                   | 3          | 3        | 9    |
| Employee            | Disrupt mission-critical operations                | 2          | 3        | 6    |
| Customer            | Alter/Delete critical information                  | 1          | 3        | 3    |
| Malicious Software  | Install persistent and targeted network sniffers   | 2          | 2        | 4    |
| Natural Hazards     | Cause power outages affecting server availability  | 1          | 2        | 2    |
