# Conducting a Vulnerability Assessment

## Objective
In this project, my objective is to conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment for a small business. The main aim is to internally review the organizationâ€™s security systems by carefully evaluating the risks associated with vulnerable information systems. I identify potential weaknesses that malicious actors could exploit. 
Upon identifying vulnerabilities, I proceed to outline a comprehensive remediation plan. This plan prioritizes addressing the most critical vulnerabilities first to strengthen the organization's overall security posture. Throughout this process, I provide actionable recommendations aimed at mitigating risks and enhancing the business's resilience against potential cyber threats.

### Skills Learned

- **Risk Assessment:** Conducted qualitative risk assessment using NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 guidelines to evaluate threat sources, likelihood, severity, and overall risk to the organization.
- **Vulnerability Identification:** Identified vulnerabilities associated with a publicly accessible database server, focusing on potential exploits by malicious actors.
- **Remediation Strategy:** Developed a comprehensive remediation strategy to mitigate identified risks, prioritizing critical vulnerabilities to enhance overall security posture.
- **Security Measures Implementation:** Recommended and outlined implementation of security measures such as strong authentication, role-based access controls, encryption, and IP whitelisting.
- **Report Writing:** Compiled a detailed vulnerability assessment report including findings, risk analysis, and actionable recommendations for decision-makers.

### Tools Used

- **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1:** Utilized for guidance on risk assessment and analysis of information systems vulnerabilities.
- **Qualitative Risk Analysis:** Employed expert judgment and qualitative analysis techniques to assess likelihood and impact of potential security incidents..

## Scenario
_You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability._

_You are tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured._

# Vulnerability Assessment Report

**Date:** 15 April 2024

## System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of the Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## Scope

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months from January 2024 to March 2024. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

## Purpose

The purpose of this vulnerability assessment is to identify and evaluate potential risks associated with the publicly accessible database server. This server is critical as it stores valuable customer and marketing data, which is essential for tracking performance and personalizing marketing efforts. Securing this server is imperative to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches that could disrupt business operations and damage the company's reputation.

## Risk Assessment

| Threat Source       | Threat Event                                       | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---- |
| Hacker              | Exfiltrate sensitive information                   | 3          | 3        | 9    |
| Employee            | Disrupt mission-critical operations                | 2          | 3        | 6    |
| Customer            | Alter/Delete critical information                  | 1          | 3        | 3    |
| Malicious Software  | Install persistent and targeted network sniffers   | 2          | 2        | 4    |
| Natural Hazards     | Cause power outages affecting server availability  | 1          | 2        | 2    |

## Approach

This assessment utilizes a qualitative approach to evaluate the potential risks. By relying on expert judgment and an understanding of the system's vulnerabilities, we identified significant threat sources and events that could impact the business. The open access nature of the server increases the risk, necessitating a thorough assessment of possible security incidents. The evaluation of threats considered their likelihood and potential impact on the company's operations and data integrity.

## Remediation Strategy

To mitigate the identified risks, we recommend implementing robust authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms. This includes enforcing strong password policies, utilizing role-based access controls, and deploying multi-factor authentication. Additionally, encrypting data in transit using TLS and restricting IP access to trusted corporate offices will enhance the security posture of the database server.

To address the identified vulnerabilities, the following security measures should be implemented:

1. **Enforce strong authentication mechanisms:** Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the server.
2. **Implement role-based access controls:** Limit user privileges based on their role within the organization to reduce the risk of internal threats.
3. **Encrypt data in transit:** Upgrade to TLS encryption to secure data being transmitted between the server and clients.
4. **Restrict access:** Utilize IP whitelisting to allow only known and trusted IP addresses to connect to the server, thereby reducing exposure to external threats.

## Additional Recommendations

### Multi-layered Security Controls

To further enhance the security of the database server, consider implementing a multi-layered security approach:

1. **Defense in Depth:** Utilize multiple layers of security controls to protect against different types of threats.
2. **Regular Audits and Monitoring:** Continuously monitor and audit system activities to detect and respond to suspicious behaviors promptly.
3. **User Education and Training:** Educate employees on cybersecurity best practices to prevent accidental data breaches and security incidents.
4. **Backup and Recovery Plans:** Establish comprehensive backup and disaster recovery plans to ensure data availability and integrity in the event of a security incident.

## Conclusion

By adopting these measures, the company can significantly reduce its vulnerability to potential threats and enhance the overall security of its information systems.
This document provides a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and remediation strategy, ensuring the company's database server is secure and resilient against potential threats.
